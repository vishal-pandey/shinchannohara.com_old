<div id="ques">
The Monk is trying to explain to its users that even a single unit of time can be extremely important and to demonstrate this particular fact he gives them a challenging task.<br>
<br>
There are N processes to be completed by you, the chosen one, since you're Monk's favorite student. All the processes have a unique number assigned to them from 1 to N.<br>
<br>
Now, you are given two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calling order in which all the processes are called.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal order in which all the processes should have been executed.<br>
<br>
Now, let us demonstrate this by an example. Let's say that there are 3 processes, the calling order of the processes is: 3 - 2 - 1. The ideal order is: 1 - 3 - 2, i.e., process number 3 will only be executed after process number 1 has been completed; process number 2 will only be executed after process number 3 has been executed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <b>Iteration #1:</b> Since the ideal order has process #1 to be executed firstly, the calling ordered is changed, i.e., the first element has to be pushed to the last place. Changing the position of the element takes 1 unit of time. The new calling order is: 2 - 1 - 3. Time taken in step #1: 1.<br>
<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <b>Iteration #2:</b> Since the ideal order has process #1 to be executed firstly, the calling ordered has to be changed again, i.e., the first element has to be pushed to the last place. The new calling order is: 1 - 3 - 2. Time taken in step #2: 1.<br>
<br>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <b>Iteration #3:</b> Since the first element of the calling order is same as the ideal order, that process will be executed. And it will be thus popped out. Time taken in step #3: 1.<br>
<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <b>Iteration #4:</b> Since the new first element of the calling order is same as the ideal order, that process will be executed. Time taken in step #4: 1.<br>
<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <b>Iteration #5:</b> Since the last element of the calling order is same as the ideal order, that process will be executed. Time taken in step #5: 1.<br>
<br>
Total time taken: 5 units.<br>
<br>
PS: Executing a process takes 1 unit of time. Changing the position takes 1 unit of time.<br>
