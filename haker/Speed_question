Rash is known about his love for racing sports. He is an avid Formula 1 fan. He went to watch this year\'s Indian Grand Prix at New 
<br>
Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on 
<br>
this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Rash 
<br>
started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed. Formally, you\'re given the maximum speed of N
<br><br>
cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car will prefers to move at its maximum speed. If 
<br>

that\'s not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible 
<br>

speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long. 
<br>
Count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.
